## CSS {#guide-css}

### Indentation {#css-indentation}

Tabs are used to indent code in all files. Tab size is equal to 4 spaces.

### Naming conventions {#css-naming-conventions}

For most of elements you can use hyphen delimited classes: `.site-nav`, `.page-title`, however <abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> notation is also used.


The naming convention follows this pattern:

	.block {}
	.block__element {}
	.block--modifier {}

`.block`
: represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.

`.block__element`
: represents a descendent of .block.

`.block--modifier`
: represents a different state of .block.

### JS hooks {#css-js-hooks}

Don't attach any JavaScript function to CSS styling classes. Instead use namespaced classes: `.js-`. For example `.js-toggle-nav` or `.js-hide-parent`.

	<input type="file" name="image" class="btn btn--primary js-upload"/>

### Style {#css-style}

	[selector] {
	    [property]: [value];
	    [- Declaration -]
	}

* One empty line is used to separate each ruleset
* One empty space before `{`
* One empty space after `:`
* Don't omit last semicolon
* For helpers you can write your code in one line but only if that helps to maintain readability.

### Comments {#css-comments}

There're 3 main types of comments used in `style.css`. Max width is 79 chars so you can use 80 chars column to wrap your css.

Comments structure is optimized for Sublime Text `Goto Symbol` function(Ctrl/CMD+ R). Each type of comments except separator type, uses special search trigger character. You can view those characters bellow.

Each type of comment is included as snippet <a href="http://github.com/Idered/esuna-snippets">esuna-snippets repo</a>.
