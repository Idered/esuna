`_assets` folder is where you put all PSD's and other source files like fonts used to generate web fonts.

In `_media` you can put all image placeholders, users avatars, etc.

`_ui` folder is where you mostly work, there're css, js and image files.

`script.js` structure inspired by [Sparky.js](http://sparkyjs.com).
