`_assets` folder is where you put all PSD's and other source files like fonts used to generate web fonts.

In `_media` you can put all image placeholders, users avatars, etc.

`_ui` folder is where you mostly work, there're css, js and image files. [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css) is used as default framework.
